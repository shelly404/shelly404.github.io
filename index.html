        <h1> Orange Cipher</h1>
        <h3> Quantum resistant, mathematically <i> unbreakable </i>, and simple enough that even an orangutan could use it!</h3>
        <div class='page'>
            Meet <b>Orange Cipher </b>. It's based of off the only cipher that's theoretically unbreakable: the one-time pad cipher. Most modern encryption relies on primes and favorable factoring odds (which quantum computers will quickly render obsolete), but Orange Cipher uses good-old fashioned keys. Do you want <i>real</i>, quantum-resistant security? You should check out Orange Cipher.

            Want to learn more? We'll have a blog post coming up any day now describing how Orange Cipher works. If you want, though, you can dive right in at <a href="http://waggish.me/orange/">waggish.me/orange/</a>.
