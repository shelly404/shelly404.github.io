                    <h3> Introduction</h3>

                      That grand, stately name which appears below the title of this infamous book, Trinneus Titan, is almost certainly a pseudonym; the mind which penned this work remains shrouded in mystery. Legend has it that Trinneus Titan was a Spanish monk who penned this short yet piercing psychological handbook after bearing witness to the atrocities of World War I and II, and in particular, the way weapons of consciousness were used to ensnare and hoodwink millions into the cunningly set traps of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin. Each of these men had functional understandings of the ins and outs of human cognition, especially where regards the entrancement and captivation of said thoughts. Each man devoted vast resources to studying and perfecting this knowledge, through the half-cooked yet already lethal sciences of hypnosis, subliminal messaging, and the result was a finely honed playbook for world conquest, mass delusion, and public exploitation. Titan was concerned that these tools, if forever kept from the public's eyes locked away in "top-secret" vaults, would only and continually be used to enrich the few who possessed them. It would only be a matter of time before another commandeering psychopath discovered their existence and exploited them to control the unsuspecting populace. Titan didn't want another Hitler, and thus he sought to eliminate the effectiveness of this deadly tool by democratizing it. He believed that if everyone could be made aware of the following psychological tricks and hypnotic bamboozlement techniques, their power would be diminished - once people understood how they might be exploited, they could prevent it. And so, Titan created "Antes El Cappur," released it into the world, and waited. 50 years later, his worst nightmare came true.

            <div class='normal'>
                From the beginning, many exceedingly powerful organizations were working to ensure that "Antes El Cappur" never reached the masses. Governments had spent billions acquiring the techniques contained in Titan's book, and were loath to see them disseminated. Initially, they took the simplest route - ensuring that all of Titan's prospective publishing deals, in Spain, but also around continental Europe, fell through for mysterious reasons. When Titan and some associates began trying to set up their own publishing outfit, opposing pressure increased.
                Rumors reached him of impending assassination attempts, forcing him to flee Europe altogether. His perennial publishing rejection, however, continued into America, and though authorities were unable to stop him from printing 50 copies of his fledging text, a feat which consumed whatever limited assets he had entirely, they remained unread until his death. He persuaded several local libraries to accept copies, and embarked on a modest tour of the U.S. to plant the remaining ones in libraries across the nation - with success, but for the fact that a government commission was dispatched to purchase and destroy the donated copies.

                If this alone was the misfortune which had befallen poor Titan, he would not have too much to be ashamed of. He may not have succeeded in making the world a better place, but he at least hadn't worsened it. Had the government commission succeeded
